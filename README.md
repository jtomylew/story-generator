This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Component Development

### Storybook (Currently Disabled)

Storybook was temporarily removed due to Next.js 15.5.3 compatibility issues. **Compatibility is automatically monitored** in all preflight workflows.

**To reinstall when compatibility is resolved:**

```bash
npm run storybook:install
```

**To check current compatibility status:**

```bash
npm run storybook:check          # Quick version-based check
npm run storybook:check:full     # Complete installation test
```

See [docs/STORYBOOK_REINSTALL.md](docs/STORYBOOK_REINSTALL.md) for detailed instructions.

### Component Inspection

While Storybook is unavailable, inspect components via:

- Main application at `http://localhost:3000`
- Component files in `/components` directory
- Browser dev tools

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
