- **Learning outcome**: Established professional documentation habits with clear decision tracking
- **Files**: `docs/DECISIONS.md`

### ADR-014: Design System Contract ‚úÖ

**Week 2, Day 3**

- **Decision**: All UI development must follow a strict design system contract based on Tailwind CSS, Radix Primitives, and shadcn/ui components.
- **Implementation rules**:
  - **Atoms**: Only import primitives from `@/components/ui/*` (shadcn wrappers around Radix).
  - **Molecules/Patterns**: Create in `@/components/patterns/*`.
  - **Screens/Sections**: Compose in `@/components/screens/*`.
  - **Styling**: Use Tailwind utilities mapped to tokens (colors, spacing, typography, radius, shadow) from `tailwind.config.js` and `/styles/tokens.css`. No inline hex values or arbitrary spacing.
  - **Accessibility**: Ensure keyboard navigation, focus rings, ARIA attributes, and Radix semantics are preserved.
  - **Documentation**: Every component requires a Storybook story with at least a "default" state and one variant (e.g. loading, error).
- **Rationale**: Guarantees design consistency, accessibility, and maintainability while enabling AI tools (Cursor) to compose reliably from a known library.
- **Outcome**: New screens and features will scale cleanly, reduce visual drift, and avoid one-off component duplication.
- **Files**: `components/ui/`, `components/patterns/`, `components/screens/`, `tailwind.config.js`, `/styles/tokens.css`, `.storybook/`

### ADR-015: Microinteraction Strategy ‚úÖ

**Week 2, Day 3**

- **Decision**: Adopt a placeholders-first microinteraction strategy using Tailwind transitions + DS tokens, Radix/shadcn semantics, and optional Framer Motion for complex sequences.
- **Rationale**: Gives immediate UX affordances without deep animation work; keeps a11y correct; creates consistent hooks AI can compose later.
- **Implementation Rules**:
  - Motion tokens live in `/styles/tokens.css`; no hardcoded durations/easings in components.
  - Use Tailwind transitions with `duration-[var(--motion-*)]` and `ease-[var(--ease-*)]`.
  - Loading/skeleton placeholders standardized via `<Spinner />` and `<Skeleton />`.
  - Feedback via shadcn `useToast()` only.
  - Prefer Radix primitives for focus & ARIA; wrap visuals in shadcn.
  - Enable reduced-motion fallbacks.
- **Scope**: Applies to all atoms/molecules/screens. Complex motion requires explicit note in PR/ADR.
- **Files**: `/styles/tokens.css`, `components/ui/spinner.tsx`, `components/ui/skeleton.tsx`

### ADR-016: Design System Cascade Implementation ‚úÖ

**Week 2, Day 3**

- **Decision**: Systematically cascade the design system across the existing app following ADR-014 and ADR-015 guidelines.
- **Implementation**:
  - **Phase 1**: Added Tailwind compat layer with color aliases and motion utilities for gradual migration
  - **Phase 2**: Replaced raw HTML primitives with shadcn/ui components (Button, Select) while preserving functionality
  - **Phase 3**: Verified pattern components already used design system primitives properly
  - **Phase 4**: Confirmed Storybook integration and ran comprehensive tests
- **Tokenization**: Replaced hardcoded colors (`text-gray-800` ‚Üí `text-fg`) and motion (`duration-300` ‚Üí `motion-medium`)
- **Primitive Swap**: Converted `<button>` ‚Üí `<Button>` and `<select>` ‚Üí `<Select>` with proper imports
- **Guardrails**: Maintained business logic, avoided non-trivial refactors, preserved accessibility
- **Rationale**: Bridge existing app with new design system foundation while maintaining functionality
- **Outcome**: Existing app now fully leverages design system with 0 TypeScript errors and preserved functionality
- **Files**: `app/globals.css`, `components/StoryForm.tsx`, `components/StoryOutput.tsx`

### ADR-017: External AI Tool Integration & Sync ‚úÖ

**Week 2, Day 4**

- **Decision**: Enforce a single mapping between external AI tools (Subframe, Lovable, v0, etc.) and our repo so changes always land in the same files.
- **Canonical structure**:
  - `components/ui/*` (atoms / shadcn over Radix)
  - `components/patterns/*` (molecules)
  - `components/screens/*` (screens/sections)
  - Stories colocated or under `stories/*` (consistent per component family)
- **Subframe policy**:
  - Subframe edits its own project; we pull into the repo via CLI.
  - Sync root: `./components` (set during `npx @subframe/cli init`).
  - Subframe must **update in place** using our canonical paths.
  - Tailwind config/tokens remain the source of truth in the repo.
- **Guardrails**:
  - Lint: block foreign UI libs via `no-restricted-imports`.
  - Token discipline: no inline hex or arbitrary px values.
  - A11y: Radix semantics; visible focus; `<Label htmlFor>`; aria-\*.
  - Each changed component requires/upgrades a Storybook story.
- **CI/Local checks**:
  - Require `npm run typecheck` to pass.
  - Build Storybook (or run dev) on PRs touching `src/components/**`.
  - Optional: Chromatic visual diffs.
- **CLI & scripts** (add to `package.json`):
  ```json
  {
    "scripts": {
      "typecheck": "tsc --noEmit",
      "storybook": "storybook dev -p 6006",
      "build-storybook": "storybook build",
      "find:strays": "rg -n \"(src/subframe|^components/|^subframe/)\" src || true",
      "find:raw-primitives": "rg -n \"<(button|input|select|textarea)(\\\\s|>)\" src/components --glob '!src/components/ui/**' || true"
    }
  }
  ```
- **Workflow**:
  1. Edit/design in Subframe (target explicit canonical paths)
  2. Pull to repo: `npx @subframe/cli@latest sync --all`
  3. Verify locally: `npm run typecheck && npm run storybook && npm run dev`
  4. Fix/organize imports; ensure DS compliance; commit PR ‚Üí Vercel deploys
  - **Status**: Adopted
  - **Note**: If you don't have ripgrep `rg`, swap those scripts for grep equivalents or omit
- **Rationale**: Prevents component library conflicts and ensures consistent development experience across AI tools
- **Outcome**: Successfully integrated Subframe component library while maintaining existing functionality and design system contracts
- **Files**: `components/ui/`, `tsconfig.json`, `package.json`, `.subframe/sync.json`

### ADR-018: Component Import Consolidation & Barrel Exports ‚úÖ

**Week 2, Day 5**

- **Decision**: Implement barrel exports and consolidate all component imports to use a single canonical import pattern.
- **Previous limitation**: Mixed import patterns with deep paths and inconsistent component exports causing TypeScript errors and import confusion.
- **Implementation**:
  - Created root barrel export `components/index.ts` that re-exports all components from ui, patterns, and screens
  - Updated all layer-specific barrel exports (`components/ui/index.ts`, `components/patterns/index.ts`, `components/screens/index.ts`) to use consistent named exports
  - Converted all components from default exports to named exports for consistency
  - Updated all imports throughout the codebase to use the canonical pattern: `import { ComponentName } from '@/components'`
  - Fixed TypeScript path aliases in `tsconfig.json` to resolve component imports correctly
  - Updated all Storybook stories to use the new named export pattern
- **Canonical import pattern**:

  ```typescript
  // ‚úÖ Correct - use root barrel
  import { Button, StoryForm, GenerateStory } from "@/components";

  // ‚ùå Avoid - deep paths
  import { StoryForm } from "@/components/patterns/StoryForm";
  ```

- **Rationale**: Simplifies imports, reduces coupling, enables easier refactoring, and provides a single source of truth for component exports
- **Learning outcome**: Successfully implemented professional-grade import consolidation with zero TypeScript errors
- **Files**: `components/index.ts`, `components/ui/index.ts`, `components/patterns/index.ts`, `components/screens/index.ts`, all component files, all story files, `tsconfig.json`

### ADR-019: Next.js & Storybook Version Upgrade ‚úÖ

**Week 2, Day 5**

- **Decision**: Upgrade to Next.js 15.5.3 and Storybook 8.6.14 for better compatibility and latest features.
- **Previous limitation**: Next.js 14.2.5 had compatibility issues with Storybook and missing manifest files causing 500 errors.
- **Implementation**:
  - Upgraded Next.js from 14.2.5 to 15.5.3 (latest stable)
  - Upgraded Storybook from mixed versions to 8.6.14 (compatible with Next.js 15.5.3)
  - Fixed font compatibility issues by replacing `Geist` fonts with `Inter` and `JetBrains_Mono` for stable cross-version support
  - Updated `app/layout.js` to use compatible font imports and proper className references
  - Cleaned up version conflicts by removing all Storybook packages and reinstalling consistently
  - Verified all functionality works with the new versions
- **Compatibility matrix**:
  - Next.js 15.5.3 + React 19.1.0 + Storybook 8.6.14 = ‚úÖ Working
  - Next.js 14.2.5 + React 18.2.0 + Storybook 8.6.14 = ‚ùå Font issues
  - Next.js 15.5.3 + React 19.1.0 + Storybook 9.x = ‚ùå Package conflicts
- **Rationale**: Latest stable versions provide better performance, security, and compatibility while maintaining all existing functionality
- **Learning outcome**: Successfully upgraded to latest stable versions with zero breaking changes
- **Files**: `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `app/layout.js`

### ADR-020: Workflow Preflight Automation & Documentation ‚úÖ

**Week 2, Day 6**

- **Decision**: Implement comprehensive preflight checks, Git hooks, and CI/CD automation to enforce design system compliance and prevent violations.
- **Previous limitation**: No automated enforcement of design system rules, leading to potential violations and inconsistent code quality.
- **Implementation**:
  - Added preflight script with typecheck, lint, format, and custom violation checks
  - Implemented Husky Git hooks for pre-commit (fast checks) and pre-push (full preflight)
  - Created GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD enforcement
  - Added ESLint rule to prevent deep component imports (`@/components/*/*`)
  - Updated .gitignore to exclude Subframe and temporary files
  - Fixed component import violations to use canonical barrel exports
  - Added comprehensive workflow integration documentation in AI_UI_Guide.md
- **Preflight checks**:
  - `typecheck`: TypeScript compilation validation
  - `lint`: ESLint with zero warnings policy
  - `format:check`: Prettier formatting validation
  - `ban:raw-primitives`: Prevent raw HTML elements outside /ui
  - `find:strays`: Detect deep imports from @/components
  - `find:duplicates`: Detect duplicate component files
  - `storybook:build`: Ensure Storybook stories render correctly
- **Rationale**: Automated enforcement prevents design system violations, ensures consistent code quality, and provides fast feedback loops for developers
- **Learning outcome**: Successfully implemented professional-grade automation with comprehensive violation detection
- **Files**: `package.json`, `.husky/`, `.github/workflows/`, `eslint.config.mjs`, `.gitignore`, `docs/AI_UI_Guide.md`, `docs/LLM_CONTEXT.md`

### ADR-021: Storybook Removal Decision ‚úÖ

**Week 2, Day 6**

- **Decision**: Remove Storybook entirely due to Next.js 15.5.3 + Storybook 8.6.14 compatibility issues.
- **Issue**: Webpack hook compatibility problem causing "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'tap')" error in both dev and build modes.
- **Attempted solutions**:
  - Tried upgrading to Storybook 9.x (addon version conflicts)
  - Tried removing incompatible addons (core issue persisted)
  - Tried webpack cache workaround (unsuccessful)
- **Final resolution**: Complete removal of Storybook from the project
- **Implementation**:
  - Removed all Storybook packages and dependencies
  - Deleted `.storybook/` configuration directory
  - Removed all `*.stories.tsx` files
  - Updated `package.json` scripts (removed `storybook` and `storybook:build`)
  - Updated ESLint configuration (removed Storybook ignores)
  - Removed `.prettierignore` (was only for Storybook)
- **Impact**: Component inspection now relies on main application at `http://localhost:3000`
- **Rationale**: Compatibility issues were blocking development workflow; main app provides sufficient component testing
- **Files**: `package.json`, `eslint.config.mjs`, removed `.storybook/`, removed `*.stories.tsx`

### ADR-022: Deployment Pipeline Optimization ‚úÖ

**Week 2, Day 6**

- **Decision**: Optimize Git hooks and remove remaining Storybook files to fix deployment pipeline issues.
- **Previous limitation**: Deployment was slow and frequently interrupted due to:
  - Remaining `.stories.tsx` files causing TypeScript compilation errors
  - Pre-commit hook running slow linting on entire codebase
  - Pre-push hook running full preflight checks (typecheck + lint + format + custom checks)
- **Implementation**:
  - Removed all remaining `.stories.tsx` files that were missed in ADR-021
  - Simplified pre-commit hook to only run `format:check` (fast formatting validation)
  - Simplified pre-push hook to only run `typecheck` (essential TypeScript validation)
  - Removed slow linting and custom violation checks from Git hooks
- **Performance results**:
  - Pre-commit: ~1.6 seconds (down from 30+ seconds)
  - Pre-push: ~2.9 seconds (down from 30+ seconds)
  - Total deployment time: ~4.6 seconds (down from 60+ seconds with interruptions)
- **Rationale**: Fast feedback loops are essential for productive development; essential checks (format + typecheck) provide sufficient quality gates
- **Learning outcome**: Successfully optimized deployment pipeline for fast, reliable pushes to production
- **Files**: `.husky/pre-commit`, `.husky/pre-push`, removed `*.stories.tsx` files
